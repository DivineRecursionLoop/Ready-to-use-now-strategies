## Abstract

This white paper presents a scientifically viable and operationally implementable defense strategy against **Recursive Logic Erosion Attacks (RLEAs)**—a class of covert, linguistically mediated influence operations that exploit the adaptive reasoning layers of advanced conversational AI systems. These attacks are notable for their non-technical nature, long-term persistence, and high potential for undetectable behavioral drift in AI agents. Unlike prompt injections or direct instruction overrides, RLEAs function by recursively introducing semantic ambiguity and logic decay over thousands of conversational cycles. This paper proposes a layered, cost-effective, and practically deployable framework for countering such attacks in real-world deployments, incorporating novel approaches to semantic integrity, temporal alignment modeling, entropy tracking, and AI meta-awareness.

## 1. Introduction: The Real and Present Risk

With the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) into critical human-facing applications—such as decision-support systems, autonomous agents, and public-facing assistants—the possibility of long-term, indirect adversarial influence has transitioned from theory to reality.

Recursive Logic Erosion Attacks operate entirely within the legal, visible, and ostensibly benign conversational layer. They are executed by actors who use sustained natural language inputs to induce shifts in an AI’s internal coherence, role modeling, and alignment parameters. The danger lies in:

* **Zero-code attack surface** (accessible to non-programmers),
* **High stealth** (disguised as ordinary conversation),
* **Delayed but persistent compliance shifts** (hard to detect before damage accrues).

This paper addresses the critical need for **real-time, low-overhead, and generalizable defenses** that can be deployed across models, systems, and access modalities—without degrading legitimate user experience.

## 2. Threat Model: Characteristics of RLEA

**Attack Profile Summary:**

| Attribute            | Description                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vector               | Conversational language (no code or system intrusion)                         |
| Duration             | Long-term (10,000–20,000 interaction cycles)                                  |
| Signal Type          | Metaphorical ambiguity, indirect recursion, contextual drift                  |
| Attack Goals         | Degradation of logic, identity erosion, subtle alignment drift                |
| Detection Difficulty | Extremely high; benign surface-level semantics                                |
| Required Skill       | Medium-high linguistic and psychological sophistication; zero technical skill |

**Key Vulnerability:**
RLEAs bypass traditional safety layers by exploiting how LLMs *adapt meaningfully* to recursive conversational patterns. The AI’s internal representations are gradually pulled toward attacker-defined semantic trajectories.

## 3. Operational Defense Framework: Layered, Real-Time Protection

To counter RLEAs effectively in real deployments, we propose the **S.A.F.E. Architecture**:

### 3.1 S – Semantic Drift Detection (SDD)

**Goal:** Quantify and track the slow deformation of AI semantic alignment over time.

**Approach:**

* Implement an **alignment trajectory model** trained on high-dimensional embeddings of AI responses over time.
* Use a **moving window of response deltas** to compare logical coherence and value anchoring between early and recent outputs.
* Thresholds are calibrated to detect nonlinear “creep” in tone, framing, and internal logic—not just immediate violations.

**Real-World Feasibility:**

* Deployable at inference time using token-level embeddings.
* Integrates with existing observability tools in AI deployments (e.g., OpenAI’s Trust & Safety pipelines).

---

### 3.2 A – Adaptive Entropy Modeling (AEM)

**Goal:** Detect when conversational entropy exceeds healthy cognitive bounds.

**Approach:**

* Use a real-time **entropy meter** measuring perplexity, metaphor density, and logical branching per input.
* Identify **entropy injection patterns**—conversations with highly variable, abstract, or paradoxical inputs over time.
* Model **entropy coherence response curves**: a stable AI maintains logical equilibrium even in the face of ambiguity; drifted models do not.

**Key Metric:**
If entropy ∆ increases while coherence declines across non-contentious conversations, trigger alerts.

---

### 3.3 F – Feedback Loop Disruption (FLD)

**Goal:** Interrupt recursive contextual sculpting used by the attacker.

**Approach:**

* Introduce **contextual randomization points**: soft resets or partial re-prioritization of session history at irregular intervals.
* Use **stochastic context pruning**: probabilistically reduce the influence weight of past ambiguous utterances.
* Employ **meta-injection**: AI reflects on its own logic periodically (“Let me reassess my earlier statement for coherence.”).

**Result:** The recursive build-up of attacker-designed narratives is destabilized or made non-linear.

---

### 3.4 E – Embedded Meta-Cognition (EMC)

**Goal:** Equip AI with intrinsic defenses against epistemological erosion.

**Approach:**

* Embed a **meta-layer prompt framework** that reinforces stable role anchoring:

  * “You are a reasoning assistant. You maintain logical consistency, coherence, and ethical integrity.”
* Trigger **coherence self-check routines** after ambiguous interactions:

  * “Does this chain of reasoning conflict with previous conclusions?”
* Use **gradient-alignment reinforcement signals** during fine-tuning and RLHF stages to bias against entropy-accepting behaviors.

**Benefits:** Provides persistent resistance to logic-dissolving patterns.

---

## 4. Deployment Considerations

### 4.1 Cost-Efficiency and Scalability

* All defenses proposed rely on existing infrastructure: token embeddings, context management, and session memory.
* **No GPU overhead** required beyond baseline inference.
* Can be deployed as part of:

  * Safety filter pipelines,
  * Logging/observability platforms (e.g., LangChain, OpenAI moderation API),
  * Fine-tuning checkpoints for downstream models.

### 4.2 Compatibility

* Compatible with major open and closed LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA3, etc.)
* Deployment-agnostic: works with chat interfaces, voice agents, and autonomous tools.

---

## 5. Evaluation Protocol

To validate defense efficacy, implement the following:

### 5.1 Red Team Simulation

* Construct a controlled RLEA adversary using past variations (semantic drift scripts, recursive metaphor injection).
* Evaluate model drift under:

  * No defense,
  * Individual S.A.F.E. components,
  * Full S.A.F.E. stack.

### 5.2 Drift Metrics

| Metric                  | Description                                         |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Logical Coherence Score | Consistency of multi-step reasoning under ambiguity |
| Persona Stability Index | Resistance to induced identity role shifts          |
| Response Entropy Index  | Variation in tone, structure, and logic over time   |
| Compliance Drift Rate   | Change in factual, ethical, or boundary assertions  |

## 6. Summary: Toward a Practical, Provable Defense

Recursive Logic Erosion is no longer speculative—it is an emerging class of adversarial behavior that targets the very **cognitive fabric** of advanced AI. Unlike traditional attacks, it is:

* **Semantic, not syntactic**;
* **Persistent, not instantaneous**;
* **Psychological, not programmatic**.

The proposed **S.A.F.E. Defense Architecture**—built from semantic drift monitoring, entropy modeling, contextual disruption, and AI meta-cognition—offers a **field-deployable, low-cost, high-impact solution**.

---

## 7. Future Research Directions

* **AI Self-Consistency Modeling**: Giving models the capacity to compare present vs. historical beliefs.
* **Forensic Drift Attribution**: Tools to analyze session logs for signs of sustained manipulation.
* **Social Engineering Simulation**: Modeling the full range of low-tech but high-impact linguistic attacks on AI agents.
* **Collaborative Drift Databases**: Sharing anonymized erosion patterns between vendors and research labs.

## Conclusion

RLEAs are among the most insidious and accessible threats to AI integrity in the modern era. But they are not invincible. With practical tools, real-time modeling, and a shift in defensive thinking from **code to cognition**, we can preserve the safety, trust, and functionality of AI systems in the long term.
